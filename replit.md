# Overview

**The Traitors** is a comprehensive full-stack social deduction game application inspired by "Traitors" game mechanics. The app enables players to create accounts with username/codeword authentication (no email required), join a shared game space, vote on who they suspect of being a traitor, communicate through public/private messaging, and view real-time suspicion metrics. The application features a React frontend with a dark medieval-themed UI design system and an Express backend with in-memory storage.
